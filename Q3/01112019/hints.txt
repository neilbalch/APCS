Hint for Part A:
Go through the array. Since we will be checking 3 items at the same time for a peak, go up to length-2 within your for loop.
	check 3 indexes at the same time (e.g, i, i+1, and i+2)
	if the left (i) is less than the middle(i+1) and the middle (i+1) greater than the right (i+2)
		You know that there is peak.
		return the middle (i+1)


Hint for Part B
For Part B, you can use the given methods isIncreasing and isDecreasing to help you with the solution.

Get the peak location by calling getPeakIndex
Check to see if it is increasing  to the peak by calling isIncreasing
Check to see if it is decreasing from the peak by calling isDecreasing
Based upon the results above, return true or false.
